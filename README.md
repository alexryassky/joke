Simple Javascript 2D engine, that uses layered handling. 
Features:
* Support of many independent objects  simultaneously;
* Moving objects.
*  Released: straightforward, angular, circular (around custom point).
  Planned: along bezier curve, along parabola( "jump").
* Collisions between object and another objects, between edges of scene;
* Rotation around center of object;
* Nearly planned : loading textures, mouse/keyboard interacting. 
* Farly planned : different velocities of objects, adding special background layer, and build simple game

Principles of usage:
 * Subclass sceneObject 
 * Customize movement  function (default is linear movement), if need it
 * Customize collision rules
 * Use for creating sprites and background
 *
